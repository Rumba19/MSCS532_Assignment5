# MSCS532 Assignment 5: Quick sort algorithm: Implementation, analysis and randomization

## **Overview**
 
 **Randomized Quicksort**: A sorting algorithm with a randomized pivot selection.
 The quicksort algorithm follows the divide-and-conquer technique for sorting the elements. It selects the pivot element, divides the array around the pivot element, and recursively sorts those partitions. 
 
The project includes:
- Implementation of the two algorithms.
- Theoretical analysis of their time complexity.
- Empirical evaluation of Randomized Quicksort vs. Deterministic Quicksort.
- Benchmarking results and insights into algorithm performance.
- It will print out the time taken by both Deterministic and randomized approaches for already sorted, reversely sorted, and random arrays.
